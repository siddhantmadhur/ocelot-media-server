# Ocelot Media Server [W.I.P.]

> This project is still in development and will be for a while. I am working on a roadmap that should give you insight into how long it will take to finish.

### Purpose
A free and open-source alternative to Plex Media Server that should look *beautiful*

### Goal
Reach full feature parity to Plex and possibly even Jellyfin.

### Questions
Here I'll answer some questions about the project preemptively

#### What is the project status?
As of right now, the project is in an **extremely** early status. The need for both a client and a server to be built together means that this will be an extremely long process. Not to mention that I am a college student and don't have too much free time to work on this. 

#### What devices will the client support?
A client is currently being worked on using Electron and React so that there is a consistent desktop/web experience for people of all Operating Systems. For mobile devices, I will use React Native so that the SDK library can be shared across both apps, reducing the work required. Thus the list of current targets I aim to support are **iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, and WebOS**. This is not a finalized list as I want a TV app as well but I am not completely sure of how I can implement that. 

#### Why not fork Jellyfin, a project that intends to have the same goal?
During my personal experience moving from Plex to Jellyfin, I encountered a few hurdles and friction that left me less than satisfied.
Not to say Jellyfin isn't an amazing project because it is and will be probably superior to this project for a very long time, but I would like to create something aesthetically pleasing, fast, and written in Golang.

#### Then why not just make a client for Jellyfin? 
I have worked on and tried to build a client for Jellyfin, which has taught me a lot about how media streaming but ultimately I believe I can make a viable alternative free of the tech debt from Emby/Jellyfin. Also, I don't have a lot of experience with C# and would personally like an alternative built in Go.
